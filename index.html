            <p class="">
                I live in Casablanca morocco,  I like programming,  writing,  and reading about history <br>
                and philosophy,  I also happen to like military stuff,  I have <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/albinism/#:~:text=Albinism%20affects%20the%20production%20of,their%20colouring%20and%20their%20eyesight.">albenism</a> <br>
                which makes me not produce melanin but I've got my ways to deal with it.
